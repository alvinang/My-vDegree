## My Virtual Degree

myvdegree.com's goal is to compile all your online education into one location allowing users to display their educational
background in one location.

#### How does this defer to typical online resumes or sites like about.me?

This site focuses on what you learn from specific courses and how did you apply it.
Theoretical understanding is important - however, the ability to apply what you learn
into real life projects is crucial.

#### Build with:

* Rails 4.0.0
* Ruby 2.0.0p247
* MySQL

#### To do

* Setup devise
* Setup facebook authentication with omniauth
* create dashboard with backbone.js
* create home page UI & dashboard
* create display page for user's virtual education

##### Future

* Display projects
* API or use mechanize to validate courses taken
