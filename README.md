## My Virtual Degree

myvdegree.com's goal is to compile all your online education into one location allowing users to display their educational
background in one location.

#### How does this defer to typical online resumes or sites like about.me?

This site focuses on what you learn from specific courses and how did you apply it.
Theoretical understanding is important - however, the ability to apply what you learn
into real life projects is crucial.

#### Build with:

* Rails 4.0.0
* Ruby 2.0.0p247
* MySQL

#### Current features
* authentication with facebook (omniauth-facebook) or email with devise
* ability to add course name, url, start/end date in dashboard

#### To do
* Facebook authentication without requiring email
* Add password confirmation for signup
* create display page for user's virtual education
* setup devise mailer with Mandrill

##### Future

* Display projects
* API or use mechanize to validate courses taken
